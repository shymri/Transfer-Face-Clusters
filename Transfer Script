"""
transfer face weights tool!!
use this tool to transfer cluster weights from one face to the other quickly!
some rules:
    put all the clusters you want transfered in one group and make that group the clusterGroup variable
    if you have grouped your clusters into groups within clusterGroup, make sure 'grp' is in the group name somewhere
